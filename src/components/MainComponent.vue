      I have created this page using HTML, CSS, and Vue 3.
      <br>
      I love everything from Middle-earth and wanted to use this page as a way to celebrate the world created by J.R.R. Tolkien

    <p>This is my dog Gimli, he is a toy Cavoodle and lives up to his namesake as a grumpy Dwarf-lord</p>
